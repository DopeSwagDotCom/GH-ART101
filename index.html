<h2> Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here </h2>
<p> Yeah pretty much this is my website... Its pretty sick. 
    I actually have been named the world's best programmer, 
    probably ever, by many prestigious institutions (harvard, yale, stanford, etc.) for my outstanding performance in the programming engine "scratch",
    so I just thought you wanted to know that. Uh yeah I am also an AGPM/EE student at 
    UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) which is pretty dope I think. We have trees
    and rain and stuff here and you probably would see that in any other lame ol college
    like ASU or UCLA, so yeah thats like my opinion. Youre welcome btw for blessing your
    temporal lobe with this awesome paragraph. Also thanks for reading I guess :p.
